# Causal Inferential Framework

This framework applies **structural equation modeling (SEM)** combined with **linear mixed-effects models** to analyze microbiome data.  

It integrates **penalized quasi-likelihood estimation** with a **debiased lasso** for robust variable selection and inference.  

Indirect effects are assessed using a **non-parametric bootstrap** procedure, with statistical significance evaluated through **bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) confidence intervals**.  

The current implementation demonstrates the approach on a **16S rRNA sputum microbiome dataset**, but the framework can be adapted to other omics data.
